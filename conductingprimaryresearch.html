		    	<h4 class="center-align">Getting started with Primary Research</h4>
		    	<p>Primary research is any type of research that you go out and collect yourself. Examples include surveys, interviews, observations, and ethnographic research. A good researcher knows how to use both primary and secondary sources in thier writing and to integrate them in a cohesive fashion.</p>
		    	<p>Conducting primary research is a useful skill to acquire as it can greatly supplement your research in secondary sources, such as journals, magazines, or books. You can also use it as the focus of your writing project. Primary research is an excellent skill to learn as it can be useful in a variety of settings including business, personal, and academic.</p>
		    	<blockquote cite="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/559/1/">But I’m not an expert!
		    	</blockquote>
		    	<p>With some careful planning, primary research can be done by anyone, even students new to writing at the university level. The information in this guide will help you to get started.</p>

  <li style="list-style-type:disc">How do you plan on discovering it? (This is called your research methods or methodology)</li>

  <li style="list-style-type:disc">How am you going to be able gain access to these groups or individuals? </li>
  <li style="list-style-type:disc">What are your biases about this topic?</li>

		  	<h4 class="center-align">Ethical Considerations in Primary Research</h4>
		  	<p>Primary research is conducted by jounalists all the time to report news and events. Companies conduct primary research constantly to find out what products thier customers would be interested in. When conducting primary research you should observe that you are conducting you research in an ethical manner</p>
		  	<p>Here are some specific points to consider:</p>
		  	<blockquote cite="http://example.com/facts">
		  		<p>You should have the permission of the people who you will be studying to conduct research involving them.</p>
		  		<p>Not all types of research require permission—for example, if you are interested in analyzing something that is available publicly (such as in the case of commercials, public message boards, etc) you do not necessarily need the permission of the authors. </p>
		  		<p>You don’t want to do anything that would cause physical or emotional harm to your subjects. This could be something as simple as being careful how you word sensitive or difficult questions during your interviews.</p>
		  		<p>Objectivity vs. subjectivity in your research is another important consideration. Be sure your own personal biases and opinions do not get in the way of your research and that you give both sides fair consideration. </p>
		  		<p>Many types of research, such as surveys or observations, should be conducted under the assumption that you will keep your findings anonymous. Many interviews, however, are not done under the condition of anonymity. You should let your subjects know whether your research results will be anonymous or not.</p>
		  		<p>When you are doing research, be sure you are not taking advantage of easy-to-access groups of people (such as children at a daycare) simply because they are easy to access. You should choose your subjects based on what would most benefit your research.</p>
		  		<p>Some types of research done in a university setting require Institutional Board Approval. This means that your research has to be approved by an ethics review committee to make sure you are not violating any of the above considerations.</p>
		  		<p>When reporting your results be sure that you accurately represent what you observed or what you were told. Do not take interview responses out of context and do not discuss small parts of observations without putting them into the appropriate context.</p>
